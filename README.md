# Compilation principle experiments

Source code for the Spring 2025 Compilation Principle experiments at the School of Cybersecurity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of various compiler components developed as part of the Compilation Principle course:

- **Lexical Analyzer:** Converts source code text into a sequence of tokens, identifying identifiers, keywords, operators, and literals.
- **Syntax Analyzer:** Parses the token stream into a structured representation (parse tree) based on the grammar rules of the programming language.
- **Semantic Analyzer:** Validates the semantic consistency of the code, performs type checking, and builds symbol tables for identifiers.

Each component demonstrates fundamental concepts in compiler construction and provides a practical implementation of theoretical compiler design principles.

## Attention

The code is for learning and communication purposes only!
